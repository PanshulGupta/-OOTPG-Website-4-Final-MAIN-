</strong></p> The East India company was a British company founded around the 1600’s, by two entrepreneurs, named John Watts, and Thomas Smythe. The East India company was known as one of the most powerful corporation, that was most famous for trading, and the production of goods, along with this this was due to the low salaries of individuals, and the savings were compensated for the increasing prices of import, and export. Around the 1600’s, Queen Elizabeth I had been proposed with an idea of ‘royal charter’, which meant that there were over 70000 pounds invested for trading outside of Europe. The East India company was known to have traded from the Cape of Good hope (Southern tip of Africa), to East Asia (~China). On August 24, 1608, the East India company attempted to sail across to India, to trade Spices, Textiles, etc. at the port of Surat.
Gradually, since trade flourished across Southeast Asia, the East India company gradually took control over various states in India, and expanded in the long run. Eventhough the East India company had a privileged position in the British government, it grew significantly due to trading spices during the period of Imperialism, which meant that the company gained rising political, and economic control of India.
In 1857, the East India company was defunct, this was because increased corruption, since they treated natives like slaves, and various other events, also including the Indian Stock Market. After the East India company, which controlled India for over 200 years, was declared defunct by the British government, the British empire took control of India.
Decades before the Indian independence, the British Empire was one of the most powerful empire in the world, due to te fact that it conquered, and took rule on over 50 countries.  A main link with the British rule and the British empire was that the British rule in India, was a part of the British Empire.

<p><strong>&nbsp; 
</strong></p>One of the main reasons for the indian independence will be mentioned in further context. The Indian ‘nationalism’ was when Indian Nationals introduced Campaigns for Indian Independence. Nationalism was when natives believed that India was more superior, and was caged by the rule. The British rule existed for centuries, and the rise in Nationalism meant that there were more protests caused, due to more need campaigns, to support the ideology.
Along with this the INC, also known as the Indian national congress was a party that was founded in the year 1885, to boost education for Indians, and create a different type of political relation between Native Indians, and the British, through the strategy of having more number/share of Indians in the British Government. Few decades after the foundation was laid, Congress started supporting independence movements, and was then led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi. Around 45 years after the establishment of INC, Congress started to get one of the highest number of votes in the elections, consequently, making it one of the most powerful focrce in India. This led to other individuals hypothesize that the British rule would grant India independence. This only continued till 1939, until the outbreak of the Second World War was established.
In addition to this, Mahatma Gandhi was an Indian Lawyer, who was responsible for the Quit India movement, and the power of congress, the Quit India movement was establish due to the rage, and agitation caused due to forcing Indian Youths and Soldiers to fight for Britain, the Allies in WWII, this also led Gandhi to increase the eagerness in Indians to not accept British Commands, which led to various protest, boosting the effect of the Quit India movement. With this, Gandhi also believed that it was not appropriate for the British Empire to demand for freedom, due to the fact that India did not gain independence, and freedom themselves, due to individuals who are asking for freedom.
Elaborating on this, the outbreak of the Second World war, the need for supplies and soldiers had increased constantly over the period of 6 years, this led to the weakening of the British Empire, and forced Indian youths to fight for the British in he war. Before mid-19th century, India's population was ~361,000,000 and was increasing massively every moment, due to this, ruling India became difficult, and led to the partition, that increased ‘religious violence’, and welcomed various other crises alongside this, therefore, forcing the British to leave their centuries of rule over India.

<p><strong>
</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  </p>
</strong></p>The Indian independence meant that India was divided into three parts, East Pakistan, west Pakistan, and India, this meant that people with different religions and ethnicities were forced to move where there was a high concentration of them. Currently, the East Pakistan is known as Bangladesh. 
In addition to this, the British also assumed that Punjab, and West Bengal should be divided into two separate countries, due to the variation in the religion not being Hindus as predicted before the map was created. Many sources suggest that the partition of India into various parts, before, and after the partition had left India in a ‘mess’, due to the diversity of ethnicities, religion, etc. this was because discrimination kept increasing, and led to physical violence, along with massive protests.
This was then emphasized by the rising riots caused due to the hypothesized partition of Punjab and West Bengal, since the new India map, released in the Midnight of August 14, led to rebels burning, and destroying estates, that were owned by individuals which lived in a minority in a specific area. The partition was the first main reason, that made the Indian independence significant, since it was the main reason for hatred, and the loss of collaboration between Hindus, Muslims, and other religions. 
The independence itself was the second most significant reason for the significance, since this exclaimed that India was now an ‘independent’, ‘free’ nation that was not in control of any empire.
